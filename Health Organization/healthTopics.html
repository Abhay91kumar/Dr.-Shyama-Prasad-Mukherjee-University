        <p id="ctag">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
        <p id="subtag"> <span id="sp">Most people infected with the virus will
            </span> experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without
            requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older
            people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic
            respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19
            and become seriously ill or die at any age.

            The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the
            virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others,
            wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get
            vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.

            The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough,
            sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.
            It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay
            home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.

    <section class="air">
        <div id="leftair">
           <p id="ai"> Air pollution is a major and pressing public health threat. WHO estimates that around 7 million people die
            every year from </p>exposure to fine particles in polluted air that lead to diseases such as stroke, heart
            disease, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases and respiratory infections, including
            pneumonia. Pollutants include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur
            dioxide. Both ambient (outdoor) and household (indoor) air pollution are harmful for health.

            Industry, transportation, coal power plants and household solid fuel usage are major contributors to air
            pollution.

            Rising at an alarming rate, air pollution impacts economies and people’s quality of life. It
            disproportionately affects women, newborn and young children. Policies and investments supporting cleaner
            transport, energy-efficient housing, power generation, industry and better municipal waste management can
            effectively reduce key sources of ambient air pollution.

            WHO activities address the urgent public health need to respond to effects associated with air pollution.
            Key interventions include informing policy-makers and the public on permissible exposure levels and the
            health impact of poor air quality, monitoring and strengthening of the health sector with knowledge and
            tools to improve air quality.

            In 2016, ambient (outdoor) air pollution accounted for an estimated 1 795 181 deaths in the country due to
            stroke, heart disease, lung cancer and chronic respiratory diseases. In homes, the major sources of air
            pollution are tobacco smoke and the smoke from solid fuels with inefficient and leaky cooking stoves.

            Following the endorsement of Global Action Plan and Monitoring Framework for prevention and control of NCDs
            in 2013, India became the first country globally to develop country specific targets and indicators, in line
            with the global framework, with targets and indicators contributing to lowering the burden of indoor air
            pollution. Further, a National Multisectoral Action Plan has been developed to facilitate achieving the
            national targets and indicators.

            The Government of India has also framed policies like National Clean Air Programme for ambient air pollution
            to address the issue comprehensively. In addition, it has implemented programmes like the Pradhan Mantri
            Ujjwala Yojna to improve access for clean energy options like LPG at the household level to the marginalised
            sections.
